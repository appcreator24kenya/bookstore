                <p>
                    When Parsimei Ole Kaelo is retrenched from his job at Agribix limited, he decides to relocate from Nakuru, where he has lived and worked for 22 years, to Nasila his native home. This change brings a poignant mood over him and family, Mama Milanoi and two daughters Taiyo (20years old) and Resian (18years old).
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Nasila they are cordially received by Simiren, Ole Kaelo’s brother. Following the relocation, the issue of fitting into the Nasila culture lingers on the Kaelo’s minds. The sensitive issue about circumcision of the girls, as per the dictates of the Maa traditions also haunts them. For the young ladies, however, they are concerned about their chances of joining university.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Ole Kaelo meets his mentor Ole Supeyo and reveals that he is in business with Oloisudori, a renowned criminals and extortionist. Ole Supeyo cautions his friend concerning any ties with Oloisudori, owing to his shady reputation and questionable morals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Ole Kaelo and his family settle into their new house in Nasila, the disturbing concern of his business association with Oloisudori incessantly lingers in his mind. Taiyo and Resian begin to notice the contrast between the life in Nakuru and that in Nasila. They appreciate the unity and harmonious way of life of the residents in Nasila.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ole Kaelo organizes a home coming party to announce his return in Nasila and a way of attempting to fit back into the Nasila way of life-a return to his roots; the Ilmolelian clan and Iloorasha-kineji sub- clan. When old Ole Musanka speaks he reminds all the visitors present about the four pillars of a home. Maa, Nasila, family and children. He also brings up the subject of circumcision and curses the Minik ene Nkoitoi the Emakererei, a woman devoted to fight FGM and early marriages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subject of circumcision brings a dark cloud of uncertainty over the Kaelo homestead in the days preceding the otherwise jubilant and successful homecoming ceremony. Taiyo and Resian are terrified at the sheer thought of Enkamuratani [the female circumciser] and her olmurunya [her tool of trade]. Although Mama Milanoi seems reluctant about taking her girls through the cut, her husband Ole Kaelo has no option but to conform to the demands of his culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Edward Oloisudori Lonkiyaa visits the Kaelo’s when Resian and Mama Milanoi are discussing about F.G.M. When he leaves, Ole Kaelo reveals to Mama Milanoi that he is the one who financed his business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oloisudori throws Ole Kaelo and Mama Milanoi into the state of turmoil when he demands to marry Resian. Resian, whose ambition is to join Egerton University to pursue a course in veterinary medicine, is totally oblivious of this development. This demand deeply disturbs the Kaelos. It was a strange demand considering the age difference, a testament to the worrying changes in cultural values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joseph Parmuat, a young music teacher, teaches Taiyo and Resian about various aspects of Nasilian culture especially about love. It is apparent that Taiyo is in love with him. The stumbling block to this infatuation is the fact that they belong to the same clan and sub-clan and thus are forbidden from any romantic ties. When it becomes clear that Parmuat is in love with her, she vows to fight for their love. On the other hand, Parmuat who is also besotted decides against the relationship since Taiyo is like a sister to him and he is scared of the consequences of such an illicit bond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Resian and Taiyo come face to face with the dark side of the Nasila culture when they are accosted by two inconsiderate youths Ntara and Lante who try to rape them. They are saved by an odd man known as Olarinkoi. The thoughtless young men are apprehended and punished severely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oloisudori’s second visit is more pompous than the first. He comes bearing gifts for all members of ole Kaelo’s family as a way of earning their affection and Resian’s love and hand in marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mama Milanoi and Ole Kaelo visit Oloisudori’s home in Naivasha and another home he’s constructing for Resian in Milimani Nakuru. They are awestricken by the sheer beauty of the magnificent homes. Ole Kaelo’s selfish needs engulf him and he warms up to the idea of having Oloisudori’s as his son-in-law due to his opulence. They hatch a plan to have Oloisudori marry Resian. They agree that if Resian turns down Oloisudori’s proposal then they would have her abducted, anesthetized (if need be), and circumcised.

                    When the stage is set for the plan to take place, Resian has other ideas. She wraps the gifts she and Taiyo had received from Oloisudori’s and duly hands them back to him giving him the wrong impression that she had given into his advances. He is baffled when Resian blurts that she wants nothing to do with him. She runs to her father’s office where they are embroiled in a bitter altercation after which runs to Nasila River and sits at the banks nursing the suicidal thoughts fuelled by the looming possibilities of  FGM, marriage to Oloisudori’s and shattered dreams of joining Egerton University.

                    Olarinkoi finds her and offers to rescue her and take her away from the village. It seems like a reasonable offer since apparently Oloisudori’s marauding gang is combing the village in search of Resian. He promises to take her to Ntare-naaju ranch to meet the revolutionary Emakererei, the rescuer of hapless girls trying to escape the callous cultural rites.

                    The journey is one to forget. While Olarinkoi sits with the driver in the cabin of the pickup while Resian has to make do with the space at the back of the vehicle. The tedious bumpy ride is a nightmare for her.

                    Resian is shocked when Olarinkoi takes her to a deserted home in Inkiito village instead of Mink ene Nkoitoi’s ranch in Ntare-naaju. He becomes hostile. He says that he wants to marry her and even attempts to rape her (He doesn't manage to rape her P 253) Nabaru says: "... what Olarinkoi tried to do with you (P 232). In the fracas that ensues, Resian bites Olarinkoi’s finger badly but is injured severely and soon slips into unconsciousness.

                    When she comes to, she meet Nabaru (the enkabaani) a kind hearted nurse who takes care of her. She also meets Olarinkois mother, the mono eyed enkoiboni. She learns that Olarinkoi and his mother have hatched a place to have her circumcised and marrying off to him. This follows prophesy by enkoiboni that her son was to marry Ole Kaelo’s daughter. Olarinkoi is force into hiding due to the shame of his thoughtless attempted rape.

                    After an agonizing 3 week long stay at Inkiito, Nabaru finally rescues Resian and takes her to Ntare-naaju, to her mentor Minik ene Nkoitoi a manager at the sheep ranch and a vet who studies at Makerere University and thus the name Emakererei. She has rescued over 500 girls from the jaws of F.G.M and forced early marriage. Resian can’t find the words to thank Nabaru. Minik gives her a job at the ranch and a place to stay. She learns that Oloisudori and her father have placed an advertisement in the papers offering a 500, 000 shillings reward to whoever would find her.

                    Five days later, Taiyo is rescued from Esoit village. She had been abducted and forcibly circumcised. She is rescued and brought to the ranch at Ntaare-naaju. Sadly, in the process of the rescue mission, Joseph Parmuat who was part of the rescue operation was captured and killed by Taiyo’s captives. Taiyo recovers slowly from the physical and psychological trauma of the incident.

                    The following day, fifth of September, Taiyo and Resian leave for Egerton University, with the help of Minik ene Nkoitoi.There is a heated confrontation when Oloisudori comes to the ranch and tries to take either Taiyo or Resian from Minik’s care. Minik ene Nkoitoi assertively tells him off before he is attacked by the workers at the ranch and his vehicles destroyed as his men and he escape lynching by a whisker.
